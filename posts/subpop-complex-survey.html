<h1>
  Subsets and subpopulations in complex survey designs
</h1>

<p>
  Generally you should <strong>not</strong> just subset complex survey data to
  do subpopulation analysis, instead using the built in tools, e.g. Stata’s
  <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/svysubpopulationestimation.pdf"><code>svy, subpop(z): ...</code></a>
  or R’s
  <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survey/versions/4.1-1/topics/subset.survey.design"><code>subset.survey.design</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  However, in the following two scenarios, subsetting versus formal
  subpopulations will give identical results:
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    The subpopulation are strata. For example, say you stratify by race where
    race can take on categories "white", "black" and "other". If you want to
    look at one race ("black") (or several races ["black" and "other"]), these
    subpopulations capture one (or several) entire strata.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every cluster has at least one member of the subpopulation.
  </li>
</ol>
