# New posts

1. Create a .html file inside `posts/`. The first line should a `<h1>`, whose
   title will be used as the page title. **This must be one-line of code, do not
   wrap onto more lines.** There are issues with the script if normal ' are
   used, use â€™ instead.

2. Update index.md to add a link to the file.

3. Update rss.xml to add a link for the RSS feed.

4. Run `make`.

`make open` will open docs/index.html
