<h1>Emacs and Dark Mode</h1>

This handles Dark Mode (on mac). If you're running GUI Emacs, this code will
automatically swap between themes based on Dark Mode status. In terminal, upon
the launch of Emacs, it will choose the appropriate theme. If you change Dark
Mode status if will <emph>not</emph> automatically update, but you can <code>M-x
reapply-theme</code> at any point to update the theme based upon current Dark
Mode.

Importantly, this requires <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">Emacs Plus</a>
for the functionality to detect the current Dark Mode status. If you'd prefer
not to use Emacs Plus, you can make GUI work like the terminal version easily.
