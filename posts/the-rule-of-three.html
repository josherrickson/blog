<h1>The Rule of Three</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The <strong>rule of three</strong> states that if a certain event did not
    occur in a sample with <em>n</em> subjects, the interval from
    0 to 3/<em>n</em> is a 95% confidence interval for the rate
    of occurrences in the population. When <em>n</em> is greater than 30,
    this is a good approximation of results from more sensitive tests.
