<h1>Making TextEdit start with a Blank Document</h1>

<p>
  It used to be that launching TextEdit in macOS would open a blank document for
  immediate typing/pasting. At some point over the last several years, it
  changed to show the file picker by default.
</p>

<p>
  To switch to the older functionality, run the following terminal command:
</p>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>defaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false</code></pre>

<p>
  Switch <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> to revert the change.
</p>
