<h1>Rebasing a Fork on Git</h1>
<p>
  There’s tons of resources online about <code>git rebase</code>, but it took me
  a while to find a solution to this specific problem.
</p>
<p>
  You have a fork of a repository. You’ve made commits on your fork, and there
  are also new commits on the original repository (call it the "upstream
  repository"). You want to pull in those changes, but <em>before</em> your
  commits, so you don’t have a merge.
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Add the upstream repository as a remote:</li>
</ol>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/&lt;upstream user&gt;/&lt;upstream repository&gt;.git</code></pre>

<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>Fetch the upstream changes:</li>
</ol>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>git fetch upstream</code></pre>

<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li>Rebase:</li>
</ol>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>git rebase upstream/&lt;branch&gt;</code></pre>

<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>Push, with a force:</li>
</ol>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt; --force</code></pre>

<p>
  What if you’ve already commited the merge? Find the hash of the last commit
  that <strong>you</strong> made, then run
</p>

<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>git reset --hard &lt;hash&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  This only works if the merge is the last thing you’ve done; if you have
  changes on your fork both before and after the branch, it’ll be far more
  complicated.
