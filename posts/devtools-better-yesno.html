<h1>A More Sane <code>yesno()</code> for devtools</h1>

<p class="note">
  There’s an updated approach in this <a href="r-package-hooks.html">new post</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When working with
  <a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org/"><strong>devtools</strong></a>, you’ll
  often be asked a yes/no question and get the annoying prompt of three randomly
  ordered and randomly worded variations of "Yes" and "No", so that you have to
  think hard to pick the right one. I get what they’re trying to do (force you
  to actually think about the question rather than hitting "Y" repeatedly) but I
  find it very annoying. Here’s a fix.
</p>

<p>
  Add this code to your .Rprofile, and you’ll now get a static 1: Yes, 2: No
  prompt.
</p>

<pre data-lang="R"><code>suppressMessages(require(devtools))
yesno <- function(...) {
  cat(paste0(..., collapse = ""))
  # For whatever reason, devtools:::yesno returns `TRUE` if you
  # select a No option, and `FALSE` if you select a Yes option
  utils::menu(c("Yes", "No")) != 1
}
utils::assignInNamespace("yesno", yesno, "devtools")
# remove stand-alone `yesno`
rm(yesno)</code></pre>
